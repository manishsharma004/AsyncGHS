### How to contribute
- Always format your code using IntelliJ Idea's *Code > Reformat Code* before pushing your changes.
- Create a new branch to work on a new feature/bug. Merge to master only after it is tested.
- Commit your changes to your branch (not master) at end of day, even if they don't work so that someone else can carry on without repeating the work.
